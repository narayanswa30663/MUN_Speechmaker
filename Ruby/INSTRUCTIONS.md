##### Note: In rare cases, the files downloaded may not be in a folder titled ‘MUN_Speechmaker-master_download’. This is due to a Github internal error, so instead of `ruby MUN_Speechmaker-master_download/Ruby/mun.rb`, you should replace `MUN_Speechmaker-master_download` with the title of the base folder downloaded.
