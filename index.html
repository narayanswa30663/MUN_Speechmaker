<p>Welcome to the MUN Speechmaker! This is an application that you can use to produce a basic outline for an MUN speech within minutes. Although this program is very useful, we strongly suggest that you do not use the product from this program as your final speech. The Speechmaker is simply intended to provide you with a basic template which you can edit and improve. While using the program, make sure to read the given instructions fully, in order to ensure that the program works at it's full capabilities.</p>

<p>We suggest that you take a look at both the files (Ruby and Python) and the results they produce before selecting the one you will actually use, as they tend to do slightly different things with your inputs.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>
