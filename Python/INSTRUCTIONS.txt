##### Note: In rare cases, the files downloaded may not be in a folder titled ‘MUN_Speechmaker-master_download’. This is due to a Github internal error, so instead of `python3 MUN_Speechmaker-master_download/Python/mun.py`, you should replace `MUN_Speechmaker-master_download` with the title of the base folder downloaded.
